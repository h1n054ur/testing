triggers:
  - implement env and gateway for all flows
  - ensure only gateway handles Twilio and HTTP logic
  - wire creds and gateway to all use cases, cover user_flow.md

# 1) Load gateway_and_env_phase2_spec
fetch_spec3{"spec_name":"gateway_and_env_phase2_spec"}

# 2) Set phase
set_phase3{"phase":"gateway-env-integration"}

# 3) In root, confirm .env has TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
# 4) Add python-dotenv to requirements.txt if needed
# 5) In main.py, load .env, get creds, exit with error if missing
# 6) In app/gateways/twilio_gateway.py, implement TwilioGateway with ALL methods covering user_flow.md features:
#       - search_available_numbers (HTTP)
#       - purchase_number, release_number, list_active_numbers
#       - send_sms, make_call
#       - get_messaging_logs, get_call_logs
#       - get/set_number_config
#       - get_account_logs
# 7) Each method handles errors and returns data/status/messages for use case display
# 8) In main.py, instantiate TwilioGateway with creds and inject into use cases at construction
# 9) In all use case files, call gateway methods for ALL Twilio/HTTP actions—never implement API/HTTP logic directly
# 10) Menus/UI never access creds or gateway directly
# 11) country_data.py remains static, never contains secrets
# 12) Test: all flows—purchase, HTTP search, manage, logs, release, settings—work via gateway only, and error if creds missing

# 13) Log outcome
log_decision3{
  "context":"gateway-env-integration",
  "decision":"TwilioGateway handles all API/HTTP logic, env creds are loaded and injected securely, and all user_flow.md features are covered."
