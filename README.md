<h1 align="center">Twilio Manager</h1>

A Python-based wrapper around the Twilio SDK,. This functional CLI tool lets you search, purchase, release, and configure phone numbers; send and view messages; place and manage calls; and inspect your Twilio accountâ€”all from the terminal. Future plans include a GUI (web & desktop), a `pip`-installable package with full `argparse` support, and seamless command-line integration.
